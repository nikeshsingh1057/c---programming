  In C: You use pointers to pass variables by reference.
  In C++: You can pass variables by reference using the & operator, which is more straightforward than using pointers.

/*The key differences between passing by reference using pointers in C and references in C++ can be categorized based on syntax, behavior, safety, and current usage trends: -> write on chat gpt to get more clear */
